# Terrain Generation Experiments

This repo is a collection of experiments for the creation of 2D terrain using a variety of techniques. All rendering of these terrains is done through the use of the SFML library.

## Noise based approach

The first approach being developed is the use of Perlin noise to create organic looking terrain and then using color coding to clarify the type of terrain created.
